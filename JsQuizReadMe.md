Perfect — it looks like your project and images are now fully pushed to GitHub! ✅

Since you asked earlier about a **README with a clickable link**, here’s a **ready-to-use README.md** tailored for your repo. It works **locally** and explains how to open your quiz in a browser:

---

```markdown
# JavaScript Quiz App

A simple **JavaScript-based quiz app** with multiple-choice questions, images, and scoring. The app displays a personalized message based on your performance.

## Features

- Multiple-choice questions
- Supports questions with or without images
- Dynamic scoring and percentage calculation
- Styled results with messages:
  - 🎉 Congratulations for 80–100%
  - 👍 Good effort for 50–79%
  - 😔 Keep practicing for <50%
- Restart quiz functionality

## Project Structure

```

├── jsquiz/
│   ├── index.html       → Main HTML file
│   ├── styles.css       → Styling for the app

└── README.md            → This file

````

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bongumusa-web/frontendProjectPractices.git
````

2. Open the folder `jsquiz/`.
3. Double-click `index.html` or drag it into your web browser.
4. The quiz will open immediately.

### Optional: Link inside README

If you want a clickable link from your README that opens locally, you can add this:

[Open Quiz App](jsquiz/index.html)

> ⚠️ On GitHub’s web interface, this will download the HTML or show raw code. To run the app, you need to **open it locally** as described above.

## How to Play

1. Read each question carefully.
2. Click on one of the answer buttons.
3. After answering, click **Next** to go to the next question.
4. At the end, you’ll see your score and a personalized message.

Enjoy your quiz! 🎉

✅ **Notes**:  
- Users will need to **download or clone** the repo to actually run the HTML.  
- The `[Open Quiz App](jsquiz/index.html)` link works locally after cloning.  

If you want, I can also make a **one-line GitHub Pages setup instruction** so your quiz opens directly in a browser with a public URL — still free and super fast. Do you want me to add that?
