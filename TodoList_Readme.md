Got it ✅ — here’s a **refined, professional, and GitHub-ready `README.md`** for your **To-Do List App**, fully based on your earlier project details and repo setup:

## 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and elegant **To-Do List web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It helps you organize daily tasks — you can add, complete, and delete items easily.
Your tasks are automatically saved in your browser with **localStorage**, so they remain even after you close or refresh the page.

---

### 🚀 Features

* ➕ Add new tasks instantly
* ✅ Mark tasks as completed
* ❌ Delete tasks you no longer need
* 💾 Persistent data storage using localStorage
* 🎨 Clean, responsive, and beginner-friendly UI

### ⚙️ How to Run the App

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bongumusa-web/frontendProjectPractices.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the To-Do List folder:**

   ```bash
   cd frontendProjectPractices/to-do-list
   ```

3. **Open the app:**

   * Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
   * No installation or server required!

---

### 💡 How It Works

* When you type a task and click **Add**, a new `<li>` element is created and added to your task list.
* Clicking a task toggles the `.checked` class, which marks it as completed.
* Clicking the ❌ icon removes the task.
* The list is stored in your browser using **localStorage**, ensuring your tasks persist between sessions.

### 🧩 Code Overview

#### `script.js` Highlights

function AddTask() {
  if (inputBox.value === "") {
    alert("You must write something!");
  } else {
    let li = document.createElement("li");
    li.textContent = inputBox.value;
    listContainer.appendChild(li);

    let span = document.createElement("span");
    span.innerHTML = "\u00d7";
    li.appendChild(span);
  }

  inputBox.value = "";
  saveData();
}
```
